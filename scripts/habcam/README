Illumination Correction at-sea impl 2013

All code is in /home/habcam/ic

The 10-minute bin to use as a lightmap is specified in /home/habcam/ic/learn_bin.conf

The bin is specified on a line by itself, with nothing else in the file. For example:

START OF learn_bin.conf
20130603_1820
END OF learn_bin.conf

It is critical that this be in the correct format of YYYYMMDD_HHM0.

If a lightmap does not exist for the specified bin it will be created.

Lightfield processing will produce output for all bins after the one specified in /home/habcam/ic/start_bin.conf

The bin is specified on a line by itself, with nothing else in the file. For example:

START OF start_bin.conf
20130603_1850
END OF start_bin.conf

Lightfield correction runs continuously and processes all images that have not yet been processed.

All output is deposited in /habcam/nmfs/proc in the appropriate subdirectory structure.

For example the output for 20130603_1820 is located at

/habcam/nmfs/proc/20130603_1820

RGB stereo pairs are written to the {bin_lid}_rgb_illum_LR subdirectory, for example

/habcam/nmfs/proc/20130603_1820/20130603_1820_rgb_illum_LR

if you want to reprocess images (they were not processed with the desired lightmap, etc) simpoly
delete the output directory, for example /habcam/nmfs/proc/20130603_1820. Do not delete input data!

Logs are written to /habcam/nmfs/proc/logs. There will be multiple logs per bin representing
every attempt to process images, and most of them will simply indicate that the bin was skipped.
Especially long ones are the interesting ones as they are a record of processing.

Logs are compressed and can be decompressed with gunzip.
