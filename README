This contains utilities, prototypes, and apps for the Ocean Imaging
Informatics project.

2012-02

Currently active is the "oii" Python module which contains manual
annotation prototypes.

To run that prototype on your local machine you will need Flask

$ sudo pip install Flask

Run it from the command line, make sure PYTHONPATH includes .

$ export PYTHONPATH=.
$ python oii/webapi/annotation.py

You can optionally specify a hostname by hacking the app.run() call
in that script.
